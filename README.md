# CapsNet
A PyTorch implementation of CapsNet based on Geoffrey Hinton's paper [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

## Requirements
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
- PyTorch
```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c soumith
conda install pytorch torchvision cuda80 -c soumith # install it if you have installed cuda
```
- PyTorchNet
```
pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/tnt.git@master
```
- tqdm
```
pip install tqdm
```

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/leftthomas/CapsNet.git
cd CapsNet
python -m visdom.server & python main.py
```
Visdom now can be accessed by going to `127.0.0.1:8097` in your browser, or your own host address if specified.

## Benchmarks
Highest accuracy was 99.57% after 30 epochs. The model may achieve a higher accuracy as shown by the trend of the loss/accuracy graphs below.

The reconstructions of the digit numbers are showed at right and the ground truth at left.

Default PyTorch Adam optimizer hyperparameters were used with no learning rate scheduling. Epochs with batch size of 100 takes ~2 minutes on a NVIDIA GTX 1070 GPU.
